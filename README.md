Imagine being a **Bank Decision Maker**.

Thousands of credit card transactions happen every minute — but key questions remain:

## ✨ LinkedIn Storytelling Version

🚀 **From Raw Transactions to Business Intelligence**

While working on financial analytics concepts, I wanted to understand how banks actually analyze credit card customers.

So I built this **Credit Card Analytics Dashboard** using Power BI.

Instead of just visualizing numbers, I focused on answering real business questions:

✅ Who generates maximum revenue?  
✅ Which customers should banks target?  
✅ Where is digital adoption lacking?  
✅ How can revenue be increased?  

The result is an **industry-style interactive dashboard** capable of supporting executive decision-making.

This project strengthened my understanding of:

- Financial analytics  
- Customer segmentation  
- KPI storytelling  
- Business-driven visualization  

Happy to share and learn from the community 🚀
